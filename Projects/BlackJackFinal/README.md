Artistâ€™s Statement

Blackjack, also known as 21, is one of the most iconic card games found in casinos worldwide. The goal of this project was to develop a digital version of Blackjack that preserves the integrity of the traditional game while enhancing player engagement through thoughtful interface design and interactive customization. This project serves as a demonstration of my technical proficiency in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, as well as my ability to integrate creative design elements into a functional and accessible application.

The artistic vision centers on creating an immersive, user-centered experience through a minimalist aesthetic. The visual design utilizez a classic color palette of green, black, and red. Players can further personalize their experience by selecting between green or red table backgrounds and red or blue playing cards. Background jazz music plays to emulate a casino atmosphere, with volume control allowing for a customizable audio. The interface is clean and intuitive, with clearly labeled controls for actions such as Hit, Stand, and Double Down, ensuring ease of use for both experienced players and newcomers.

To improve accessibility and player decision-making, the game features a helper/recomendation button. The array behind it includes optimal moves for every possible combination of player and dealer hands. Creating this logic required generating and efficiently structuring a dataset that reflects basic Blackjack strategy principles.

From a technical standpoint, the game includes a locally stored login system, allowing players to create accounts secured by a four-digit PIN. User progress, including accumulated tokens, is saved and displayed on a local leaderboard, encouraging replayability and friendly competition.

Through a combination of interactive design, personalized features, and smooth user flow, I believe this project successfully delivers both a technical and artistic engaging digital Blackjack experience.
